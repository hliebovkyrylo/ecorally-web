          Pollution in Ukraine isn’t just an environmental issue—it affects our
          health, wildlife, and future generations. Illegal dumpsites, littered
          waterways, and urban waste piles degrade the land we cherish. EcoRally
          tackles this by giving every Ukrainian the tools to fight pollution
          directly.

          From small village cleanups to large-scale urban projects, every
          action adds up. We’re building a community-driven solution to address
          local challenges, whether it’s clearing plastic from the Dnister River
          or removing debris from war-affected areas. The app also encourages
          sustainable practices, like sorting recyclables during cleanups.

          Together, we can protect Ukraine’s landscapes, from the Carpathian
          Mountains to the Black Sea coast, and create a cleaner, prouder
          nation.
